        <p>Beginning in the 1960s, software engineering was seen as its own type of engineering. Additionally, the development of software engineering was seen as a struggle.
        It was difficult to keep up with the hardware which caused many problems for software engineers. Problems included software that was over budget, exceeded deadlines, 
        required extensive de-bugging and maintenance
        and unsuccessfully met the needs of consumers or was never even completed.
        In 1968 NATO held the first <q>Software Engineering</q> conference where issues related to software were addressed: 
        guidelines and best practices for the development of software were established. [4]</p>
